== asm.css

=== What is asm.css?
asm.css is a css _assembly_, it is meant to be used in other projects.

.Example
----
display: flex -> .di-fx
direction: rtl -> .di-rtl
border-style: none -> .bost-n
display: table -> .di-ta
height: auto -> .he-au
----

=== Naming
1. Property naming: First two letters of each word (e.g. `box-sizing-> bosi`)
2. Single word value naming: First two letters of each word.
3. Multi-word value naming: First letter of each word.
4. Single word conflicts: the next syllable is taken
   (e.g. `style -> sty-le -> sl`),
5. Multi-word conflicts: resolved by taking the next unique letter
   (e.g. `max-content -> mac, min-content -> mic, wrap -> wr, wrap-reverse -> wre`)

   from.

** I recommend postcss-compose
* How is this different from Tachyons?

   vertical-align folder

   up classes.
** asm.css doesn't bundle normalize.css.
